Solaris and other POSIX compliant operating systems.

SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS
==============================================================================

    Before you install Sedna Python driver, ensure that you have the
following basic software installed:

    * The driver is based on the SWIG (http://www.swig.org/) wrapper of
      Sedna C driver, so you need to install the latest version of SWIG.
    * C-compiler: for example Visual Studio C++ Express Edition on
      Windows, gcc on *Nix.
      Note! Use the same Visual Studio C compiler your Python
      binaries distribution was compiled with. As far as we know Python 2.6
      and higher is built with VC9 (Visual Studio 2008).
    * Python 2.4 and higher. You also need python-dev package on some
      *Nix operating systems.

    If you will be building Sedna Python driver together with Sedna C
    Driver from Sedna sources then you will also be needing:

    * CMake build system (http://www.cmake.org/) since Sedna is configured
      using CMake
    * Proper Make utility to build C driver (make on *Nix; nmake on
      Windows)

GENERAL NOTES
==============================================================================

    You have two ways to build and install Sedna Python driver:
    you can build it using Sedna binaries or you can build it from
    scratch together with Sedna C driver (useful for 64-bit systems)
    from Sedna sources. You can configure the process via config.py
    file. This file contains two variables: SEDNA_BIN_PATH and
    SEDNA_SRC_PATH. Installation script first searches in SEDNA_BIN_PATH
    for Sedna C driver prebuilt library and relevant headers.  If all
    is ok, then it will build Python driver using them. However, if it
    doesn't find prebuilt Sedna C driver it will try to build it from
    scratch using Sedna sources pointed by SEDNA_SRC_PATH. If this isn't
    what you want then set SEDNA_SRC_PATH to an empty string. In this
    case, if the script cannot find prebuilt Sedna C driver it will exit
    with an error. On the other hand, if you want to skip searching of
    prebuilt libraries and build from scratch, then set SEDNA_BIN_PATH
    to an empty string and SEDNA_SRC_PATH to some meaningful value.
    Platform specific sections that follow assume building from Sedna
    binary build.

    Remember, that if you want to build the driver from scratch you can
    always build Sedna C driver manually from the source distribution
    and then build Python driver via SEDNA_BIN_PATH.

WINDOWS INSTALLATION
==============================================================================

    1. If you do not have Sedna installed on your system, download and
       install the latest stable binary build. It is available at
       http://modis.ispras.ru/sedna
    2. Check that swig, python, Microsoft C compiler and linker
       are accessible through PATH variable. Properly adjust PATH if
       they are not. Note! Use the same Visual Studio C compiler your Python
       binaries distribution was compiled with.
    3. Define SEDNA_BIN_PATH variable value in config.py file:

         e.g. SEDNA_BIN_PATH="C:\\sedna"
    4. Run:

         python setup.py build

       to build python driver.
    5. Run:

         python setup.py install

       to install python driver.


*NIX (32-BIT) INSTALLATION
==============================================================================

    1. If you do not have Sedna installed on your system, download and
       install the latest stable build. It is available at
       http://modis.ispras.ru/sedna. You can install Sedna either from
       sources or prebuilt binaries.
    2. Ensure that Python development package is installed (if this
       is relevant for your OS).
    3. Define SEDNA_BIN_PATH variable value in config.py file:

         e.g. SEDNA_BIN_PATH="/home/user/sedna"

    4. Run:

         python setup.py build

       to build python driver.
    5. Run:

         sudo python setup.py install

       to install python driver.

*NIX (64-BIT) INSTALLATION
==============================================================================

    For now, we don't provide prebuilt 64-bit Sedna binaries. So, to
    build Python driver on 64-bit system you must build it together
    with Sedna C Driver from scratch. For details, see "INSTALLATION
    FROM SCRATCH USING SEDNA SOURCES" section

INSTALLATION FROM SCRATCH USING SEDNA SOURCES
==============================================================================

    1. Download and unpack the latest Sedna SOURCE distribution from
       http://modis.ispras.ru/sedna.
    2. Ensure that CMake and Make utilities are installed (cmake and
       make/nmake commands are available via PATH).
    3. Ensure that Python development package is installed (if this
       is relevant for your OS).
    4. Define SEDNA_SRC_PATH variable value in config.py file:

         e.g. SEDNA_SRC_PATH="path-to-sedna-sources"

    5. Run:

         python setup.py build

       to build python driver.
    6. Run:

         python setup.py install (or 'sudo python setup.py install'
         on *Nix)

       to install python driver.


PACKAGE STRUCTURE
==============================================================================

    Sedna Python driver consists of two modules:

    * libsedna.py - automatically generated warapper of the C API.
                    It can be considered as a low level API and
                    functionally equivalent to the C API.  Type "import
                    libsedna" to use it.

    * sedna.py    - high level wrapper of the libsedna.py.
                    This is the preferable way of using Sedna python
                    driver.  Type "import sedna" yo use it.
